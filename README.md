# Azure Cloud Resume Challenge
Hello, Welcome to my Cloud Resume Challenge for Azure.

I embarked on this project with the goal of diving into the intricacies of cloud technology and familiarizing myself with the associated tools. 
Initially, my understanding of the cloud was minimal at best. I initially experimented with Google Cloud, but soon realized it wasn't the right fit for me. Thankfully, a friend suggested giving Azure a shot.

Fast forward to today, and I've earned my first certification AZ-900 Azure Fundamentals and my learning journey continues. 
It took me approximately 40 to 50 hours to bring this project to fruition, but don't let the time investment deter you. I've documented my progress on GitHub, hoping that it can serve as a valuable resource for others facing similar challenges as I did.

## Prerequisites
- AZ-900 certification (can skip this till project is finished)
- Resume written in HTML, CSS, and JS 
- Some knowledge in Python
- Github Account
- Azure Acccount
- Visual Studio Code
    - Extensions: Azure Account, Azure Tools
